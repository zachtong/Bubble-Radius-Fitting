"""Frozen application state dataclass with immutable update helper.

AppState is a frozen dataclass: field reassignment raises FrozenInstanceError.
All state transitions go through ``update_state()`` which returns a new instance
via ``dataclasses.replace()``, making state changes explicit and trackable.

Pragmatic compromise: NumPy array *contents* remain mutable (element-level
assignment like ``state.radius[idx] = value`` still works) because copying
large arrays on every frame would be wasteful.  The key benefit is that all
*field-level* reassignments are funneled through ``update_state()``.
